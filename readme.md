##Lucys Boilerplate  
 
 A boilerplate template for my projects. This is a quick way to get started without having to set everything up every time.It covers some basic issues in cross browser compatibility.


##Notes:

-Based on HTML5 Boilerplate (https://www.html5boilerplate.com)  
-Includes SCSS for Foundation framework(https://www.foundation.zurb.com)  
-updated directory structure so assets are contained in the assets directory

##How to use this:
1. On the main repository page, click the download zip button to get a zip file of the boilerplate.
2. Extract the Zip File and Rename the file to the name of the new project you want to start with the boilerplate-this will be the project root directory.
3. Move the project root directory from your downloads to where you want to keep your projects.  
4.Start working on your projects!
